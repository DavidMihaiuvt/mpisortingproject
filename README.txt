Here is my Python code and results of the tests.
As I mentioned, the experiment has been done in PyCharm.

How my code works?
I used funtions with the name sort from 1 to 13, and then added a couple functions to be able to help me produce the results easier.
After all functions end, when I want to just create a random list I use the create and print function, with the other commands being a comment.
Then, after creating a desired list,I print it in the data notepad the list, I comment the create list line, and uncomment the other 13 calls. From there I just wait until the program manages to produce and print all the results in the data notepad.
If I want to produce another list, I just comment again the sorting calls, uncomment de create line and just repeat this.
When I got sorted lists I just added some lines in the create and print function to be able to print in the list file a list that is ascending or descending order.

The .py file is just an executable. In the archive is all the files in the folder. If you cant access the code through these variants, I also added a code.txt file that has the code in it.
